to do

fix the cabling. 
coat in white the inside of the dome

once the dome is fixed and the lighting is stable. take a pic of the inside of the dome, in the gallery space, without a line. then use that picture and subtract it to the one you get with the line. 
that will help to reduce all the shadows and unwanted effects, that are constant.
